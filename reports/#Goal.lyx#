\begin_layout Title
MALSIM: Multi-Agent Learning Simulator and Benchmarking Tool
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author
Drew Wicke
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multi-agent learning simulator (MALSIM) will be a simulator and benchmarking
 tool for multi-agent learning algorithms written in Java.
 The goal of MALSIM will be to provide mulit-agent learning researchers
 a common framework in which to compare and test various MAL algorithms.
 MALSIM will solve various problems in the multi-agent learning community.
 However, in order to create MALSIM technical challeges will be encountered,
 various technologies used and a user friendly GUI created.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the multi-agent learning community, when testing a new algorithm empirically
 the results are ususally based on few trials and compared to few opposing
 algorithms.
 MALSIM will provide the multi-agent learning community the needed generic
 testbed for benchmarking and simulating new learning algorithms.
 MALSIM will provide generic mechanisms to simulate, test and visualize
 experiments.
 Currently their are a couple of very good simulators made for multi-agent
 systems, however they do not provide a benchmarking mechanism

 Multiagent Learning Testbed (MALT) provides serverices similiar to that
 of MALSIM

.
 MALT is extensible and offers a built in mechanism to graph and visualize
 the results of experiments.
 However, MALT is coded in MATLAB and is made for two player repeated matrix
 games.
 Based on the usefulness of previously created tools the need for a common,
 generic and extensible testbed for multi-agent learning algorithms is apparant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to provide this tool technical challenges such as a generic implementat
ion and the inherant dificulties of parallel programming will be encountered.
 The tool must be generic enough to provide the standard features of any
 simulated game and yet stay functional for all types of multi-agent learning
 algorithms.
 Also, while programming the tool for a multithreaded environment challenges
 such as deadlock, race conditions and communication will be addressed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MALSIM will be written in Java in order to be platform independant.
 Technologies such as XStream, a tool that serializes Java objects to and
 from XML, will be used to provide a mechanism to save and load the tool's
 model

 Also, JFreeChart will be used to provide a way to visulize in a graph based
 form the results of the experiment

\begin_layout Standard
A GUI as shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 will be provided.
 The GUI will allow the user to set up the experiment by setting things
 like the game to be played, the agents to be in the tournament, the mechnism
 to choose what agents play against each other, as well as other properies
 of the experiment.
 The GUI will also provide a view of what current games are being played
 a way for users to pause them.
 When the experiment is finished the user will be able to view and save
 the results of the experiment.
 The GUI will also give the user the option to view and create graphs to
 compare and contrast the data from the experiment.
